Happier Ghasts is a minecraft mod that provides QoL changes to Happy Ghasts to 
increase their use cases and improve airship adventuring.

*Take to the skies, adventure awaits you!*

## Features

*\~ Everything is configurable! \~*

- **Cruising Altitude**<br>
  Boost flight speed while cruising at high altitudes.

- **Player-Centric Roaming**<br>
  Happy Ghasts will now roam around the last player to dismount them — no more
  fiddling with leads to keep your happy companions around!

- **Higher Temptation Range**<br>
  Tempt Happy Ghasts with snowballs from farther away. Say goodbye to chasing
  wayward airships!

- **Propeller Upgrades**<br>
  Attain speed boosts by attaching a propeller to your Happy Ghast's Harness.
  Propellers come in several tiers, from copper all the way to netherite, and
  perhaps beyond...?

## Planned Features

- Visual propeller models on the backs of Happy Ghasts.
- Happy Ghast Armor.

modpacks/videos/etc without contacting me for approval.
